Abstract Name Service
=====================

*Status: Alpha*

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/abstract-ns) |
[Github](https://github.com/tailhook/abstract-ns) |
[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/abstract-ns)

This rust crate provides just abstract traits which may be used to build
interoperable implementations of name dicovery.

We want abstract_ns to have implementations not only for DNS-based name
discovery but also Zookeeper, Eureka, Etcd, Consul, and whatever other thing
you might imagine. All of them easily configured and interchangeable.

Features:

* Defines what is a name and what is a result of service discovery
* Uses futures-rs for asynchronous stuff
* Has interface to receive updates (name changes)
* Allows some kind of name service routing, i.e. has a way to specify different
  resolvers for different names, for example: serve `*.consul` from local
  consul, other names from conventional DNS servers.

This repository also contains the following crates:

* ``ns-std-threaded`` a name resolution implementation that uses stdlib
  resolver running in a thread pool
* ``ns-dns-tokio`` an pure-rust implementation that uses ``domain`` crate to
  resolve domains asynchronously in ``tokio-core`` main loop

Note: abstract-ns v0.2 is very different product than v0.1
