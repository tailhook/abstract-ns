//! Abstract traits for name service library
//!
//! Here are small breakdown:
//!
//! * `Name` is currently an alias to `&str` (but it may change in future)
//! * `Address` is a structure which address resolves to. It's more than just
//!   a `SocketAddr` you have used to, but there is `Address::pick_one()`
//!   which does quick and dirty solution
//! * `Resolver` is a structure which is a configured resolver. You may use
//!   many different resolvers in your application.
//!   Use `Resolver::resolve(name)` to get a future `Resolver::subscribe(name)`
//!   to get a stream of updates.
//! * `MemResolver` is an in-memory hash table for addresses you may use for
//!   tests
//! * `Router` is a way to specify different sources for different names, for
//!   example serve `*.consul` from local consul, other things from
//!   conventional DNS servers
//!
